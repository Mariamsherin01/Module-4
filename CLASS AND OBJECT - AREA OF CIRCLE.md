## CLASS AND OBJECT - Calculate Area of a Circle Using Class 

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that takes the radius as input from the user and calculates the area of the circle using a class named 'cse' and a method named 'mech'.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Define a class named cse.

2.Inside the class, define a method mech that takes the radius as an argument.

3.Calculate the area using the formula area = Ï€ * r^2 (use math.pi).

4.Print the area rounded to two decimal places.

5.In the main code, take input from the user for the radius.

6.Create an object of class cse and call the mech method with the input radius.

class cse:
    r=int(input())
    a=(3.14161)*(r**2)
    def mech():
        cse.a
r=cse()
print("Area of circle: %.2f"%cse.a)
cse.mech()



```
