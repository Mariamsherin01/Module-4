# Exp.No:17  
## EXCEPTION HANDLING

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that handles the exception caused by trying to add an integer to a string, and prints a specific error message without crashing the program.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Write a code block that tries to add an integer to a string (e.g., "hello" + 5).

2.Wrap the operation inside a try block to monitor for exceptions.

3.Use an except Exception block to catch any exception that may occur.

4.Inside the except block, print the message: "You can't add int to string".

5.This ensures the program handles the error gracefully without terminating unexpectedly.
